User visible changes for lzop -- a very fast file compressor
==================================================================

Changes in 1.03 (01 Nov 2010)
  * Assorted minor updates.

Changes in 1.02rc1 (25 Jul 2005)
  * Made lzop compile with LZO v2.
  * Under Windows files are now opened using the _O_SEQUENTIAL flag,
    which results in a major speedup when (de)compressing large files.
  * Under MacOS X, the configure script now will use the '-no-cpp-precomp'
    compiler option in order to work around bugs in Apple's native
    "smart" preprocessor.
  * File sizes > 2GB are correctly displayed.

Changes in 1.01 (27 Apr 2003)
  * Five years have passed since the last release: completely updated
    the Autoconf build system, enable Autoconf large file support.
  * Warn about a compressed file's trailing zero bytes only if in
    verbose mode (for compatibility with recent versions of GNU tar).
  * Don't be to strict in favoring stdin - using '--no-stdin' should not
    be necessary any longer in cron jobs.
  * Added option '-P' to save/restore the path name of a compressed file.
  * Added option '--crc32' to use a crc32 instead of a adler32 checksum.
  * Fixed an assertion that could trigger in very rare cases.
