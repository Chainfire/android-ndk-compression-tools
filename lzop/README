Introduction
------------
lzop is a file compressor similar to gzip. Its main advantages over gzip
are much higher compression and decompression speed at the cost of
some compression ratio.

lzop was designed with the following goals in mind:
  - speed (both compression and decompression)
  - reasonable drop-in compatibility to gzip
  - portability


Short documentation
-------------------
For detailed usage information please take a look at doc/lzop.txt.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.


General functionality and behaviour has been modelled very closely
after gzip. The main differences between lzop and gzip are:

- Files compressed by lzop will have the suffix '.lzo'

- lzop does not delete the input file(s) by default.
  You have to use the option '-U' if you want this behaviour.


lzop uses the LZO data compression library for compression
services. See http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/ .
